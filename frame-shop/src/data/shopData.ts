export const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I know if my motorcycle frame or powertrain is out of alignment?",
    a: "Common warning signs include: high-speed wobble or rear-end 'sway' above 65mph, the bike pulling to one side when letting go of handlebars, uneven rear tire wear, premature drive belt edge fraying, or unusual motor vibration after installing performance upgrades."
  },
  {
    q: "Why isn't a factory stock motorcycle frame always straight?",
    a: "Factory production tolerances allow small margins of error. When you add high-torque engines, upgraded suspension, or aggressive cornering, these minor offsets multiply. Additionally, minor tip-overs, pothole impacts, or engine removals frequently pull motor mounts and swingarms out of true alignment."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an appointment for service?",
    a: "Yes. Paul operates by appointment only to ensure every motorcycle receives undivided focus and zero-tolerance precision measurement without rush. You can book an appointment online or call (832) 628-5226."
  },
  {
    q: "What types of motorcycles do you work on?",
    a: "We specialize in Harley-Davidson (Baggers, FXRs, Dynas, Softails), Indian Motorcycles, Performance Cruisers, Custom Choppers, and Classic V-Twins. We also handle frame diagnostics for custom builds and crashed motorcycles."
